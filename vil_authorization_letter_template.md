Dear IRIS Foundation, 

My IRIS Token Private Sale reference number is [201*-**-T*-***], and I have a total of # IRIS tokens which are locked for ?? months starting from the IRIS Betanet launch date. 

I hereby authorize IRIS Foundation to delegate total [#] of my locked IRIS tokens to following validator(s):

|  Seq No   |   Validator Adress   |   Delegation Amount 

|    1      |      [iva***]        |       # 

|    2      |      [iva***]        |       ...

I shall take immediate title to the reward tokens as a result of my authorized delegation action, if executed successfully, and shall receive the reward tokens at the account address [iaa***] which I own and have private key to operate.

I certify that I understand the fact and take full responsibility that: 1) I might lose my delegation tokens, in part or whole, due to risk factors that include but are not limited to protocol flaws, security holes, and byzantine attacks; 2) my delegation tokens might get slashed by the protocol, in part or whole, due to malicious,compromised and/or negligent validator operations.

When the locking period of my delegation tokens expires, the IRIS Foundation shall unbond my delegation tokens immediately, and transfer them to my account address [iaa***] (unless I specify another address at unlocking time), after the unbonding period then in effect in the network.  I understand and accept that the unbonded delegation tokens might be less than the original amount of [#].

I certify that I own the account addresses for receiving reward tokens as well as unlocked tokens mentioned in this letter, and I have the private keys to operate them at my own discretion.

I have read through and understood the concepts and risks mentioned in the following documents provided on the IRISnet webside:
