Since July 20th 2018, the IRISnet community has been running the Fuxi testnet and has made several major improvements. On Nov 26th 2018, On-chain software upgrade was tested successfully by validators. This capability made it possible for IRIS Mainnet to  begin launching POS essential modules while adding more advanced functions gradually such as IBC and i-services etc < links to Cosmos and IRISnet whitepapers )
through decentralized on-chain governance.

 
Now the community is looking forward towards moving beyond the testnet environment tofor a production environmentreal-world experience. The core development team for IRISnet, Bianjie <link bianjie.ai>, is starting the final technical preparations for its Betanet launch.
